# Rocket Explorer
### _A simple side-scrolling app to explore the solar system_


An interactive side scrolling webapp, showcasing the most well known planets/moons/stars and (soon) man-made objects such as satellites and rockets. Rocket Explorer is intended to be educational and a learning experince for me, the creator, but welcomes anyone to enjoy the content and maybe learn something new about the solar system!

I have chose this project as one of my starting projects because I thought it would be a fun experience and I would learn more than I would if I made a simple website (_which I have done already_). Along with many interests and passions of mine, space and space exploration is one of them. I aim to use this project as a heavy learning experience and boost my confidence in creating more intricate and exciting projects!

This app is easy to use!
